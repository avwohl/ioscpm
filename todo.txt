Since last we ran there was a mac os update,
 and a new xcode, and a new xcode command line tools

This project is to create a ui for ios and mac.
It is for ../romwbw_emu. A z80 emulator
that can boot many different z80 operating sytems.

romwbw_emu recently spit off from cpmemu.  In our files there
may be ties to files in either. If something is missing we use
it will be in one of thoses.
../cpmemu and ../romwbw_emu are sister directory project.

It looks like we have a copy in Core/ of hbios_dispatch, and qkz80
that is wrong, we should compile them out if the sister directories
not keep private copies.

hbios* files got a major rewrite since we last where built I think.
There are two exsting working romwbwb_emu systems:
 - rombwb - linux command line emulator
 - rombwb_emu/web - the shared hbios compiled to web assembly
This two used to each have their how hbios.  But most of it was the same or supposed to be.
The common part is now shared.
Update our system :
 - delete all qkz80 files in this ioscpm
 - delete the hbios files in this tree that we should use the ones

In hbios_dispatch are many declarations of names like HBF_VDAINIT 0x40.
A few of were wrong in the web assemble code that had thier own defines.

Review all the code in this project.  Any constants should be checked.

In debugging remember the CLI and web versions work.

The lower levl (romwbw_emu and cpmemu (for qkz)) seem stable now.
Get our sources in alignment with those libraries.
Get this working again
romwbw_emu/docs/IOS_PORTING.md has notes on the library changes that session thought you should know bout
