Create an IOS app from an existing project.
The existing project we wrote is ~/src/cpmemu.
It is underoing major changes in anouther claude session
so keep any changes you might want in the project to merge in later.
Write an IOS app to run Z80/8080 operating systems/roms.
The current cpmemu is targeted at the CP/M os but it is getting
RomWBW support right now to run MP/M and many other OSes.
In the cpmemu sources there is a build to webassembly.  So the core
is designed to be veyr portable.  Hopefully you can build a native IOS
app to integrate the existinng emulator code.

Each emulator window would run a cpmemu instance.  Mainly its just
character io like the webassembly version.  disk IO should go to disk
images we supply or the user can make a file of there own. Don't worry
too much about disk format for now the current cpmemu work will take care of
disk formats.  Id start with a tradtional floppy image like cpmenu defaults to.

xcode is installed with the IOS emulator.
I installed and setup the xcode command line tools
I have an new ipad air to test with.
I did not setup with testflight or whatever its caleld to get apps into it yet.
I do have an apple developer account
