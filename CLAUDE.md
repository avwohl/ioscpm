# Claude Code Notes for iOSCPM

## Fixing "Simulator Busy" Errors

When the iOS Simulator reports busy/failed preflight, run ALL these steps in a SINGLE command:

```bash
pkill -9 -f "Simulator" 2>/dev/null; pkill -9 -f "simctl" 2>/dev/null; xcrun simctl shutdown all 2>/dev/null; launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService 2>/dev/null || true; rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/iOSCPM-* 2>/dev/null; echo "Done"
```

Do NOT run these as separate steps - always run as one combined command.
